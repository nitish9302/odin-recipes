    <h2><u>: Description :</u></h2>
    <p><em>
    <p>Shahi Paneer can literally be translated to “royal paneer.” My recipe is that of a rich, creamy curry made with a base of nuts, onions, yogurt and spices.</p>
    <p>Paneer is a fresh cheese that is popular in Indian cuisine. It is made by curdling milk with a food acid (often lemon juice), then pressed into cubes. The most notable thing about paneer cheese is that it does not melt, providing a texture similar to tofu.</p>
    <p>There are some variations to make the recipe. Some Shahi Paneer recipes use tomatoes and butter. I have opted not to use these ingredients, instead using yogurt to lighten up the dish considerably. </p>
    <p>The Shahi gravy is full of fragrant flavors including onion, ginger, garlic, red chilli powder, saffron and cardamom. Balanced out with thick, creamy yogurt, this lightened up version of Shahi Paneer is perfect for special occasions.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for a warming, comforting vegetarian dish to serve for supper, look no further. Shahi Paneer is one of my very favorite dishes and is sure to become one of yours, too.</p></em></p>
    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>

        2 tablespoons cooking oil
        </li>
    <li>

        1 large onion, thinly sliced
        </li>
    <li>

        4 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
    <li>

        1 teaspoon ground cumin
        </li>
    <li>

        1 teaspoon ground coriander
        </li>
    <li>

        ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
        </li>
    <li>

        ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder
        
        </li>
    <li>

        4 tomatoes, pureed
        </li>
    <li>

        ½ pound paneer, cubed
        </li>
    <li>

        ¼ cup water
        </li>
    <li>

        1 teaspoon white sugar
        </li>
    <li>
        
        salt to taste
    </li>
    <li>

        ¼ cup cream
        </li>
    <li>

        2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <em><b>Steps to Make it :</b></em>
        <p>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart. Cook until the paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve. </li>
